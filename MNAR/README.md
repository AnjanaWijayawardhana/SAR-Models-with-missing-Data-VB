# SEM Estimation under MNAR

This folder contains all the packages, functions, and algorithms needed to estimate **Structural Equation Models (SEM)** under **Missing Not at Random (MNAR)** conditions using:
- **Variational Bayes (VB) algorithms**
- **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm**

## How to Use
1. **Download the whole folder** to your local machine.
2. **Set the working directory** to this folder before running any code in R files.
3. **Run the scripts** as needed for your analysis.

## Prerequisites
- R and required packages installed
- Familiarity with SEM and Bayesian inference
